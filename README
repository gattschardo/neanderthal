Neanderthal is an implementation of the German game ``Im Neanderthal''.

For more information, read the code, or buy the game.

If you don't know German, this may not be for you, until I or someone else
can be bothered to create a translation - which is unlikely, as this is thought
mainly as a small exercise in the language Go, not as a real project.
